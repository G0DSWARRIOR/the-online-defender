WRITE ME AN APP THAT I CAN SEND AS A FILE AS A WINDOWS PROGRAM  THAT CAN FIND A PERSISTENT THREAT ACTOR(S) CONSTANTLY INTRUDING INTO THE NETWORK THAT THE APP IS DEPLOYED ON, FIND THEM AND LIST THEIR IP ADDRESS AND CITY LOCATION, BLOCK THEM, BUT THE USER IS ABLE TO ADD THEIR OWN DEVICES THEY TRUST THROUGH THE NETWORK THE PROGRAM IS ON. MAKE IT BEGINNER FRIENDLY AND REALLY ABLE TO USE BY THE AVERAGE PERSON NEW TO THE NETWORK SECURITY FIELD. HAVE THE PROGRAM BE A WINDOWS FILE ABLE TO BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO MY CLIENTS.
